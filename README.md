## Kit & Ride

A crazy idea to collect and publish interviews with cyclists the world over. [Check it out.](http://kitandride.com)

### Wanna submit your story?

I'll post a guide of how to do this later, but if you know GitHub, Jekyll, and Markdown you can have at it. Create a new post in the `_posts` directory and answer the following:

* How did you come to cycling?
* What are you riding right now?
* Are you a weekender? Commuter? Racer?
* What is one of your favorite routes?
* What’s your favorite kit?
* What cycling magazines, books, clubs, or websites do you enjoy?
* What’s in your jersey pocket on a long ride?
* Favorite cafe stop? What do you get?
* Favorite Rule?

Be yourself. Share your story. Have fun. Inspire others.
