### How did you come to cycling?

I bought a new mountain bike the day after we bought our house in Marin in 2004. Mountain biking was invented here, right? I went on a few rides, and I was terrible. It was a full-suspention bike, and it was crushing to feel so much of my effort going into the shocks. I didn't know what I was doing, but I knew I was done.

Last Christmas we bought our son Blake a mountain bike. He was thrilled. After a day or two of riding it around the school parking lot, he asked if we could go for a bike ride together. Whoops. Nobody else in the house had a bike! I decided to take advantage of the holday time off and pick up a cheap used bike [at Re-Cyclery](http://www.tripsforkids.org/marin/recyclery.htm). I got an [80s Univega Sportour with friction shifters](http://instagram.com/p/iaHhEsEkpS/) and it was incredible.

Blake and I went on rides together around town and explored the bike paths. I had no idea there is this huge network of roads around Marin designated for bikes. It was like a secret society. I rode to the ferry a few times and did the [China Camp Loop](http://parks.ca.gov/?page_id=466) and was hooked.


### What are you riding right now?

Today I'm riding a [Raleigh Revenio Carbon 2](http://www.raleighusa.com/bikes-road-endurance-race-revenio-revenio-carbon-2). This was taken on my first full commute into San Francisco:

The Univega is a great bike, but it turned out to be too big for me. I'm 6'1" and the Univega is a 61cm. The straight bars help, but it's still a reach and unfortunately I'd never be able to reach the drops if I changed the handlebars.

I knew just enough about cycling to know that I loved it, and I wanted to go fast. I test rode a handful of different bikes at [Mike's Bikes](http://mikesbikes.com/) and once I felt what carbon feels like, there was no going back.

## Are you a weekender? Commuter? Racer?

I enjoy over a hundred miles a week on my bike. I commute to San Francisco from Marin a few times a week (I cycle to the ferry if I'm feeling lazy) and try to get one solid effort in on the weekends. I'd like to try out some big group rides soon and maybe a century this summer.

If you're really curious you can [follow me on Strava](http://www.strava.com/athletes/1551425).

## What is one of your favorite routes?

[Paradise Loop](http://www.strava.com/routes/307950) is hard to beat. It's a fun and quick 30 mile loop from my house with a perfect cafe stop at the halfway point. You can find yourself alone among Paradise if you get out early, but even as the day warms up you'll see more cyclists than cars. The rolling twisty hills are incredibly fun and the views are stellar. It's fun to [tack on China Camp](http://www.strava.com/routes/403888) if you want to extend the ride a bit.

My commute to work is pretty amazing, too. I get to fight for PRs over [Camino Alto](http://www.strava.com/segments/3668777?filter=overall) and the climb from [Sausalito to the Golden Gate Bridge](http://www.strava.com/segments/132513?filter=overall).

## What's your favorite kit?

I'm still a total n00b, so my kit is just random bits from here and there.
I've never had cycling shoes before, but I love my [Specialized Expert Road shoes](http://www.specialized.com/us/en/ftr/shoes/road-shoes/expert-road). I can't imagine going for a long ride without my Castelli endurance bibs. Cycling shorts are unconcionable once you've had a good pair of bibs on.

I just bought a pair of [Oakley Style Switch](http://www.oakley.com/products/7171/27293) prescription sunglasses as well. They are a dream. The polarized lenses take a minute to get used to, but the amber/brown lenses help immensely nearly any time of day. My [Walz cycling cap](http://www.walzcaps.com/caps_moisturewicking.html) helps keep my forehead from burning up in the morning and keeps the sweat out of my eyes too.


## What cycling magazines, books, clubs, or websites do you enjoy?

Everything I think I know about cycling I learned by watching [GCN videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/globalcyclingnetwork). Once the passion was lit, though, I needed more. I read every article on [Velominati](http://www.velominati.com/) and [The Radavist](http://theradavist.com/). I have a subscription to [Bicycling magazine](http://www.bicycling.com/) and [Cyclist magazine](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cyclist-road-cycling-magazine/id553437963?mt=8), which I read on my iPad or iPhone. I similarly devour everthing on the [Rapha site](http://www.rapha.cc/) and adore [Rouleur](http://rouleur.cc/).

## What's in your jersey pocket on a long ride?

If it's not in Strava, it didn't happen. Given that, the most important thing in my jersey pocket is my iPhone. I carry a bit of cash and a card for stops and [Clif Shot Bloks](http://www.clifbarstore.com/detail/CLF+118061) for fuel emergencies.

In direct violation of [#29](http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/#29), I carry two CO2 cartridges, a spare tube, tire levers and a multi-tool in a saddle bag on every ride.

## Favorite cafe stop? What do you get?

[Cafe Acri](http://www.yelp.com/biz/caffe-acri-tiburon) in Tiburon is legendary. It's the perfect half-way mark on Paradise Loop and you'll always be in good company with other cyclists. I grab a cappuccino with an extra shot and the yogurt and granola if I'm peckish. I ride the loop clockwise, which means I'm going after Camino Alto on the way out of town so I'm eager to fuel up and get to it.

## Favorite [Rule](http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/)?

I think about [#5](http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/#5) and [#10](http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/#10) on every ride. I absolutely love that about cycling. I still struggle with a few, though, namely [#24](http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/#24), [#33](http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/#33), and [#68](http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/#68).
