### How did you come to cycling?

I started riding  a [Jamis Commuter](http://www.jamisbikes.com/usa/street.html) when I lived in Massachusetts. I was terrified of streets and hills and spent most of my time cruising slowly down the sidewalk. When I moved to Berkeley and then San Francisco, I began commuting 7 miles a day during rush hour, which initiated me quickly into the fast-thinking bravery of city riding. In January of 2013 I decided to get serious. Problem was - I didn't really know where to start. I remember walking into Mojo one day and working up the courage to ask one of the mechanics what I'd need on a long ride. She set up my distance tool kit, installed my cleats, explained routes to go on, taught me about nutrition, and offered solidarity as a female cyclist in a very male sport. She made it seem possible. 4 months later I did the 350 mile Climate Ride from Eureka back down to SF, and I haven't stopped riding since.

### What are you riding right now?

A [Jamis Satellite](http://www.jamisbikes.com/usa/satellite-sport-femme.html). It's heavy and clunky but has served me so well. I bought it new in 2008, but thanks to a serious wreck it's been almost completely replaced. New frame, new fork, new front wheel - I think the only components that are original are the back wheel and crankset. I'm ridiculously brand-loyal to Jamis and am planning on buying their carbon Xenith this winter, once the Shimano 105 11-speed comes out.

### Are you a weekender? Commuter? Racer?

All three! The bike community in the Bay Area is so diverse, and I want to take part in all of it. I help organize [SF Bike Party](http://sfbikeparty.wordpress.com/) every month, leading hundreds of cyclists around the city in pursuit of adventures. On the weekends I like logging miles and climbing mountains, getting out of the city and reconnecting with the hawks and wildflowers. And every other month or so I participate in hard fast alleycat races in Oakland and the East Bay, putting my legs to the test and cheering on my competitors. 

### What is one of your favorite routes?

It's simple and not long, but I absolutely love biking through Sausalito and climbing up that quiet residential hill in Mill Valley to Four Corners, and then zooming down Panoramic and Shoreline home again. Round trip it's only 35 miles but even on a hot day it's cool and quiet, and can be knocked out in a morning. If I'm riding solo I almost always do that route.

### What’s your favorite kit?

All the ones I can't afford. I personally prefer kits that represent something you've done as opposed to how much money you have in your bank account. [Wheel Talk - TVC](http://www.wttvc.com/) has gorgeous kits. I'm working on getting fast enough to race with them someday, so I can sport their spandex!

### What cycling magazines, books, clubs, or websites do you enjoy?

Honestly, 99% of my cycling information comes from my community. I love that cyclists are so into sharing knowledge with one another! My friend Patrick Dowd just finished the Trans-Am race and runs a great blog called [Worn Treads](http://www.worntreads.com/). Similarly, I love Jenny Oh's blog [Plattyjo](http://www.plattyjo.com/blog/). I like reading bike blogs that remind me why cycling is fun, and inspire me to pump up my tires and hit the road with a smile on my face. 

### What’s in your jersey pocket on a long ride?

I've been carrying around this gross raspberry Clif goo for weeks now. I keep thinking I'll need it halfway up a mountain, but it's so unappetizing that it just gets passed from one jersey pocket to another. Also SPF 50+ sunscreen. I'm from England and burn in seconds. Skin cancer is not sexy. 

### Favorite cafe stop? What do you get?

[Mojo Bicycle Cafe!](http://www.mojobicyclecafe.com/) I've started drinking iced coffee instead of beer after long rides to keep me awake when I get home. You can sit outside, and the bike mechanics who work there rule. 

### Favorite [Rule?](http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/)

Rule #19: Introduce yourself. When I was a baby cyclist trying to change my own flats on the side of the road, or riding with a new group where I didn't know anyone, it was a lifesaver to have someone introduce themselves to me. I try to pass on that kindness to other cyclists, whether they're seasoned bikers adventuring with a new crew, or starting out over the bridge in clipless pedals for the first time. Good attitudes and great friends make climbing any mountain in a headwind fun.
