### How did you come to cycling?

I rode bikes with my father growing up. We'd explore the neighborhood and new
construction projects happening. I stopped as I grew up, but rediscovered
cycling in college. Georgia Tech had a program where abandoned bikes on campus
were fixed up and if you volunteered with them you could get a bike for free. I
made a bike rideable and then started commuting, quickly starting to explore
track racing at Dick Lane Velodrome and doing longer rides.

### What are you riding right now?

I got a couple bikes. I have a 1985 Schwinn Peloton with Suntour Superbe Pro
which is my relatively fancy, yet understated commuter. I feel bad about not
keeping it completely true to its age, but I'm still playing with it I race and
do long rides on a 2011 Specialized Allez that's gone through some upgrades in
my years of ownership and riding. I also have a Surly LHT built for touring,
and a few bikes I'm in the process of selling :cry:

### Are you a weekender? Commuter? Racer?

All of the above :smiley_cat: I commute everywhere possible via bike since I started
riding as an adult. Weekends have always been a time for long rides, but I've
also started racing road this year with [Wheeltalk-TVC](http://www.wttvc.com/).

### What is one of your favorite routes?

I love heading up Mount Tamalpais via Marion up through Pantoll Station. This
gets you up to the peak of the mountain in less than 30 miles. The view is
fantastic, fog or not and the climb is always fun.

### What’s your favorite kit?

This is a tough question. I love wearing kits from clubs and organizations in
which I have friends. [Faster Mustache](http://www.fastermustache.org/) will
always have a special place in my heart since I started riding with them. I
can't wait for my team's summer kit, and the Team Rapha Focus CX kits are super
slick.

### What cycling magazines, books, clubs, or websites do you enjoy?

I like glancing over lots of random things even though I get a good bit from the
community that I chat with. I hang out at the [Rapha Cycle Club in San
Francisco](http://www.rapha.cc/sfc) a good bit since my girlfriend works there
and its a great place to stop before or after a ride. I also read [Manual for
Speed](http://manualforspeed.com/), [The Radavist](http://theradavist.com/), and
[Cycle Exif](http://www.cycleexif.com/) to giggle and look at cool things.
[Cycling Tips](http://cyclingtips.com.au/) is nice for something a bit more
serious as well.

### What’s in your jersey pocket on a long ride?

A hand pump and a fat multitool. You never know. Also my mother always told me
to never leave the house without a $20. I try to continue that while riding my
bike.

### Favorite cafe stop? What do you get?

I already mentioned [Rapha Cycle Club](http://www.rapha.cc/sfc), but after that
I'm a fan of the Fairfax Coffee Roastery. They're located right at the turn for
the Alpine Dam ride and next to Sir Francis Drake, so I stop by often.

### Favorite [Rule?](http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/)

I'm not a fan of the rules. While they're tongue in cheek, I've met some folks
who take them seriously and that annoys me. Rule #1 is ride your bike. Rule #2
is have a blast.
