### How did you come to cycling?

I bought my first road bike when I was 31, a [Bianchi Dama Bianca Elle](http://static.flickr.com/103/287662327_2f5e0c19d9.jpg). I wanted to venture beyond the spin classes in the gym. I was pretty slow and remember the first "long" ride (i.e. over an hour) I went on with a couple of cycling friends ending with me calling a black cab, out in the middle of the countryside, to bring me and my Bianchi home, totally beat.

Following a traumatic separation, at 33, I decided to throw my self, and most of my bank balance, at long distance triathlon. I bought a Cervelo P2, and we rode many a therapeutic mile together.

Since preparing for Iron distance triathlons, where the bike part is 180km, long rides have now become my comfort zone!


### What are you riding right now?

I mostly ride my new tri bike, a [Cervelo P3](http://www.cervelo.com/en/bikes/p-series/p3.html).

I'm 5' 2" and it's always tricky to find good bikes that fit me. Cervelo make their range into very small sizes, to suit smaller people, not women specifically, which I appreciate. I'm not a fan of the "pink it and shrink it" approach of some brands. My bike is a 45cm frame size, which is so small it means 650c wheels. I also have super short 155mm cranks. I have electronic shifting, which is *smoooth*. I'll spend a lot of hours on this bike, so I wanted to love every thing about it. I had the fit fine tuned at Retul, and it feels great!

I have a [Cervelo S3](http://www.cervelo.com/en/bikes/s-series/s3.html) for some pure fun road rides, which I kitted out to be more of a classy road bike with red Chris King hubs and the understated Enve carbon wheels.

I also have a [Specialized Fate](http://www.specialized.com/us/en/bikes/archive/2013/fate/fateexpertcarbon29), their women's hardtail 29er, for the occasional venture to the dirt side.


## Are you a weekender? Commuter? Racer?

I'm an athlete ;) I train on my bike 5 days a week, maybe 6 lately because... I can. I had a collision with a car 4 months ago, where I broke my leg and got a bit bashed up. I'm very grateful to finally get out on my bike again, and start building my fitness and strength back up.

## What is one of your favorite routes?

There are loads of rides on my doorstep in Boulder that I love. I love Lefthand Canyon up to Jamestown, which is sadly still not quite open, or restored, since the vast flood damage last year.

As a favorite anywhere, I'd pick the winding El Golfo loop on the ironman course in Lanzarote. Like every route in Lanzarote, it can be brutal depending on the winds. The landscape harsh, but stunning.

## What's your favorite kit?

I like a lot of Rapha's kit, and their growing women's collection.

I'm friends with Hillary Biscay, co-founder of [Smashfest Queen](http://smashfestqueen.com). Their kits make me smile, which helps!

## What cycling magazines, books, clubs, or websites do you enjoy?

I don't really read about, or watch, other people cycling much. I follow a few cyclists on Strava and Instagram. I enjoy seeing where others are riding.

## What's in your jersey pocket on a long ride?

Caffeinated gels, which would be kinda gross any other time but... easy and do the job. A Bonk Breaker bar. Money for emergency snacks. Heaven forbid I'd be short on fuel ;)

## Favorite cafe stop? What do you get?

Some routes have a special stop, like the store in Glenhaven (on the [epic ride to Estes Park](http://www.strava.com/activities/79023328)) that sells cinnamon buns about the size of my head.

Probably my favorite cafe stop is [Mary's](http://www.marys-market.com). It's only about 15 miles from home, but sometimes it's a life (or bladder) saver. I refill water or pre-mixed Scratch Labs drink, or a Mexican coke will see me home with a bit of ooomph.

## Favorite [Rule](http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/)?
I know enough to keep myself out of trouble riding with a group, but most of my long training rides I do solo... so I stay blissfully unaware of a lot of cyclist etiquette. One of my favorite, helpful(-ish) sayings is, "Go hard or go home". I'm still working on the go *hard* bit, but mental and physical endurance I have in heaps.
