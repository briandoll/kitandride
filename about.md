I'm not sure yet, exactly. I'm a big fan of [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/about/) by [waferbaby](http://twitter.com/waferbaby) who describes this project as:

> The Setup is a collection of nerdy interviews asking people from all walks of life what they use to get the job done.

I was reading my very first copy of [Rouleur](http://rouleur.cc/) today. The writing is incredible, the scenes are vivid and the photography is exceptional. I couldn't help but wonder, though, what sort of stories my cycling friends might have. I need to feed my newfound cycling addiction, so let's see what happens here.

Like The Setup, Kit & Ride will feature a series of interviews with a set list of questions. Unlike The Setup, the interviews will be written by riders of all sorts.
