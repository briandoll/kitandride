I would love to hear your story. If you already know about GitHub, Jekyll and Markdown, [have at it.](https://github.com/briandoll/kitandride). I'll be posting a tutorial on using GitHub for contributing, but for now just [email me](mailto:brian@emphaticsolutions.com) your answers with photos and links and I'll post 'em.

The interview questions for each post are:

* How did you come to cycling?
* What are you riding right now?
* Are you a weekender? Commuter? Racer?
* What is one of your favorite routes?
* What’s your favorite kit?
* What cycling magazines, books, clubs, or websites do you enjoy?
* What’s in your jersey pocket on a long ride?
* Favorite cafe stop? What do you get?
* Favorite [Rule](http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/)?

Be yourself. Share your story. Inspire others. Have fun.
